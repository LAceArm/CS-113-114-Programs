Some of these files were provided for the courses by the instructors and were thus not written by me, but are still intergral to the function of many of the programs, so it was imperative that I include them in the repository.
These files include the interface Dictionary.java and UAL and OAL dictionary classes. These were sourced from 'Data Structures and Algorithm
Analysis' by Clifford A. Schaffer available at https://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/JAVA3elatest.pdf
Additional files, such as Pronunciation.java were provided, but were not sourced from Schaffer
